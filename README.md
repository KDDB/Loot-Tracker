Farm-Where you write where you are farming.  
MF-How much magic find you have.  
Item-The item you found.  
Disable Logs-When filled in, it disables a log from being written when you close the app.  
Loot-The loot button confirms the item drop and adds it to the list at the bottom.  
Runs-Trackers how many runs you have done.  
Plus(+)-This adds a run to the run counter.  
Finished- This the proper way to close the program which will log your run if it isn't disabled.  

The logs are created in a seperate folder called Logs and will create them every day the program is ran.
